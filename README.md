# React Apollo Boilerplate

### Description
A basic boilerplate to setup react, apollo client, apollo server and nodejs hapi server. I've included many of the libraries I normally use in a react project. The objective is to keep the functionality simple so that I can update all libraries to the latest versions and explore changes and new features easily. Making it public provides access to potential contributors. Front and back ends can be together or individually.
